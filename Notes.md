# Coordinate System
- Right hand coordinate system, `-z` runs into the screen
- `+x`: to the right
- `+y`: up
- `+z`: out of the screen (towards you) 

# Basic Steps
1. Calculate the ray from the eye to the pixel.
2. Determine which objects the ray intersects.
3. Compute the color for that intersection point.

# Definitions
- `focus length`: Distance between the projection plane and the projection point <br>
